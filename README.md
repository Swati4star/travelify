## How Travelify Works

While travelling from one place to another, there are a lot of factors to be considered in order to make the trip a memorable one. Travelify helps the traveller with anything and everything that he might need from the moment he plans the journey till the time he is back home happy and content.

The platform includes a wide variety of options - from selection of Mode of Transport, to finding out about the destination city to provision of best music, novels depending on the mood of the traveller. Travelify basically works in 2 phases.


## Select Destination
A comprehensive list of all the information one would need to know about a city, be it current weather of the city or a list of best hangout places there.

 > **The current trends of the city on twitter can be also seen by the user
(A city trend may or may not be same as what we usually see on *Trending on Twitter.com*)**

Based on this information and the recommendation from the app, user can opt for the best destination location for him.

## Travel
+ **My trips**

 > History of all the past trips of the user at one place so that he can categorically view all the photos from his trips and also see how much each person (who was on that trip along with the user) spent on different things for future reference.

+ **Transport**

 > Book and search for bus and railway tickets from this app itself. For car, we let the user know about the total toll taxes and the total cost of fuel he has to bearsdfds.

+ **Hotel Booking**
+ **Online Shopping**
+ **Real Time Locator**

 > While travelling in the destination city, user usually doesn't know much about the nearby location. We provide the users with real time details about the nearby places, monuments, restaurants, hotels (so that, he can also take a detour) and medical centres.


## Utilities
+ **Share contact**

 > To save the job of typing and then saving the contact details of a fellow passenger, simply share the contacts using a unique QR code.
+ **Checklist**

 > We need a checklist because remembering everything required for your perfect trip is quite cumbersome.

## Music Player (Mood Detection)

Travelify tries to find the current state of mind or the **mood of the traveller** on the basis of his activity and selections on the app and hence recommend him songs accordingly. It uses a heuristic approach by extracting the ```tempo``` and ```energy``` of the song selected by the user. It creates a matrix for each user's each journey and as user uses the app more frequently, it improves the suggestions to complement the actual mood of the user. 

## Push notification
Push notification in between the journey. Often it happens that while travelling alone, a person tends to doze off. Push notification (alarm notification) feature saves the traveller from missing out the destination station.
